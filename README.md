<h1>
    React ⚛️ Axios 🚀 API 🔗 Testing 🧪 Using Postman 📮
</h1>
<p>
🚀 This project encouraged me to work with Axios to get, post, patch, and delete data from the API. Furthermore, I have used Postman in this project for testing API. 🧪</p>

    <p>
        While I was using Postman, I realized that testing an API is a fundamental part of any real-world application. Postman provides a great user interface as well as a user experience to test an API and check the fundamental requests and their responses. This was the first time I have explored any API testing tool and I have gained practical knowledge. The knowledge I have explored about the Postman is mentioned below:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            What is an API?
        </li>
        <li>
            Create a workspace
        </li>
        <li>
            Create a collection
        </li>
        <li>
            Variables in Postman
        </li>
        <li>
            Query parameter
        </li>
        <li>
            Variable path
        </li>
        <li>
            Create an HTTP request using GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE methods.
            <ol>
                <li>GET method</li>
                <li>POST method</li>
                <li>PATCH method</li>
                <li>DELETE method</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
